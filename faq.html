            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
            <h2>Where can I use Satchl?</h2>
            <p>We are actively working to add vendors. To find out where you can currently use Satchl, please see our list of Vendors. If there are additional places you want to use Satchl, please let us know on social media and we will let vendors know their customers are asking for it.</p>
            <h2>Why don’t I have the option to tie more vendors to my account?</h2>
            <p>If you don’t have the option to add more vendors, it is because all available vendors have already been tied to your account. We just launched and are actively working to add vendors. To find out where you can currently use Satchl, please see our list of Vendors.</p>
            <h2>I scanned my Satchl QR code at a vendor location, but it didn’t work; why?</h2>
            <p>This could happen for a few reasons. Check on these items:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The token is “Enabled.” Go to “Tokens”, tap on the token tied to your phone, and you should see that the token is “Enabled” and NOT “Disabled”</li>
                <li>The vendor is toggled on for your token. Go to “Tokens”, tap on the token tied to your phone, find the vendor and you should see the toggle to the right should be to the right and green and NOT to the left and gray.</li>
                <li>The “Account ID” for the vendor is correct. Go to “Vendors”, tap on the vendor you are trying to use, and verify the “Account ID” is correct.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Should my spouse and I have our own Satchl accounts?</h2>
            <p>Most likely, no. Most households share loyalty and membership accounts, so it is more practical to use a single Satchl account and provide the other account information once in Satchl. However, if you and your spouse do not share many accounts, then it would be more practical to have separate Satchl accounts.</p>
            <h2>After I added vendor account information, it was added to all my tokens; why?</h2>
            <p>We designed Satchl with households in mind. Generally, households share a single account for each loyalty program, membership, etc.; Satchl is no different. It is assumed that each token will be assigned to each phone used in the household. Thus, if vendor information is provided, it is assumed all members of the household will share it that same information. We understand some memberships or accounts may have subusers or different profiles within a vendor account. We have accommodated for this: for applicable vendors, subuser or profile information can be added at the token level.</p>
            <h2>Should my spouse and I have our own Satchl accounts?</h2>
            <p>Most likely, no. Most households share loyalty and membership accounts, so it is more practical to use a single Satchl account. However, if you each have your own account to most accounts, then it would be more practical to keep separate Satchl accounts.</p>
            <h2>Why does Satchl require a verified phone number and email?</h2>
            <p>Satchl uses these to prevent fraudulent account creation. We also use this information to help users recover their Satchl Username and/or Password. Satchl is designed to simplify account access and creation. With participating vendors, Satchl will provide your email and/or phone number in order to jump-start enrollment. We call this feature “Auto Enroll.” Generally, this will be done for loyalty programs. Satchl will only provide this information to applicable vendors. You can turn Auto Enroll off for any token. Some vendors may operate purely using a verified phone number or email and do not require account creation. These vendors will automatically be tied to your tokens and you will not have the option to change the account IDs associated with those vendors.</p>
            <h2>I have deleted the token tied to my phone (there is no QR code when I go to the “Scan” screen on the app), how do I fix this?</h2>
            <p>To do this, you simply need to create a new token and assign it to your phone. On the app, go to “Settings” and under your phone number, click the dropdown menu to select a token to assign to your phone. You can use the token you already created or create a new token.</p>
            <h2>I created an account at Satchl.com, how do I use a token?</h2>
            <p>In order to use Satchl, you must download the Satchl app from the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store. After signing in, go to “Settings” and from the dropdown menu select a token to assign to your phone.</p>
            <h2>Can I use the same Satchl account on multiple phones?</h2>
            <p>YES! Simply download Satchl on each phone and log in. This is a great option for households.</p>
            <h2>Can I use the same Satchl token on multiple phones?</h2>
            <p>No, a token can be assigned to only one phone. Even if you log into another phone, you will have to assign a different token to that device in order to use the “Scan” screen.</p>
            <h2>I turned “Limited” on for the token tied to my device. But I have forgotten my password and cannot turn off the “Limited” setting. How do I fix it?</h2>
            <p>You need to reset your password. You can do this by going to the login screen and clicking on “Forgot Password – Click to reset.” You can do this from the app or from the website.</p>
            <h2>In the app, should I add vendors through the “Vendor” screen or by clicking “+ Vendor” when I’m looking at a specific token?</h2>
            <p>You can do either! Regardless of where, when you add a vendor, it will automatically be added to all tokens. But when you use “+ Vendor”, there may be an opportunity for a subuser or alternate account ID for some vendors. That subuser or alternate account ID will apply only to that token. This is to support families who share a vendor account but use separate subuser profiles or alternate IDs.</p>
